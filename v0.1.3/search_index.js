Optimises either only atomic positions (variablecell=false) or both positions and lattice (variablecell=true). Returns a named tuple including the optimised system as first entry. Typical arguments passed as solver are Autoselect() (the default), OptimLBFGS(), OptimCG(), OptimSD(). These automatically choose some heuristics for setting up the solvers, which we found to work well in practice.\n\nBeyond that any other first-order solver compatible with Optimization.jl can also be employed. Note, that in principle all such solvers should work, but we only tested a small fraction and you can expect that minor modifications are needed to make some solvers work (PRs appreciated!). In general only first-order or second-order methods work.\n\nSee GeometryOptimization.clamp_atoms for an experimental way how to clamp atoms.\n\nKeyword arguments:\n\nvariablecell: Determines whether the cell is fixed or allowed to change during optimization\nmaxiters: Maximal number of iterations\nmaxtime:  Maximal allowed runtime (in seconds)\ntol_energy: Tolerance in the energy to stop the minimisation (all tol_* need to be satisfied)\ntol_forces:  Tolerance in the force  to stop the minimisation (all tol_* need to be satisfied)\ntol_virial: Tolerance in the virial to stop the minimisation (all tol_* need to be satisfied)\nmaxstep: Maximal step size (in AU or length units) to be taken in a single optimisation step (not supported for all solvers)\nverbosity: Printing level. The idea is that 0 is silent, 1 displays the optimisation progress and ≥ 2 starts displaying things from the calculator as well (e.g SCF iterations).\ncallback: A custom callback, which obtains the pair (optimization_state, geoopt_state) and is expected to return false (continue iterating) or true (halt iterations). Note that specifying this overwrites the default printing callback. The calculation thus becomes silent unless a GeoOptDefaultCallback is included in the callback.\nkwargs: All other keyword arguments are passed to the call to solve. Note, that if special kwargs should be passed to the Optimization.OptimizationProblem the user needs to setup the problem manually (e.g. OptimizationProblem(system, calculator))\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"examples/aluminium_dftk/#Aluminium-supercell-using-density-functional-theory","page":"Aluminium supercell using density-functional theory","title":"Aluminium supercell using density-functional theory","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"examples/aluminium_dftk/","page":"Aluminium supercell using density-functional theory","title":"Aluminium supercell using density-functional theory","text":"In this example we will optimise the structure of a rattled aluminium system using density-functional theory.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/aluminium_dftk/","page":"Aluminium supercell using density-functional theory","title":"Aluminium supercell using density-functional theory","text":"First we build a rattled aluminium system:","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/aluminium_dftk/","page":"Aluminium supercell using density-functional theory","title":"Aluminium supercell using density-functional theory","text":"using AtomsBuilder\nusing Unitful\n\nsystem = rattle!(bulk(:Al; cubic=true), 0.2u\"Å\")","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/aluminium_dftk/","page":"Aluminium supercell using density-functional theory","title":"Aluminium supercell using density-functional theory","text":"Next we create a calculator employing the density-functional toolkit to compute energies and forces at using the LDA density functional.
